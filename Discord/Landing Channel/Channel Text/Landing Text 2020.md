**Welcome to the Twitch Plays Pokémon Discord Server!**

### IMAGE: 1 Rules.png ###

:one: **Be respectful to others.**  
Limit profanity, keep to the channel topic, spoiler tag appropriately, and show empathy.

:two: **Don’t spam.**  
Be mindful of the current discussion when deciding to post something. Put large blocks of text in pastebins and excessive images in imgur albums, or throw them in #bots.

:three: **No porn.**  
Nothing explicitly sexual. Don't make others uncomfortable. Report anything that makes you uncomfortable either by DMing @Server Staff or by using the Mailbox.

:four: **Don’t mob.**  
Don't group troll, brigade, raid, or witchhunt the stream, subreddit, other users, or other communities.

:five: **Don't advertise your stream or Discord server** until you are active in the community. 
Simply joining and advertising is not welcomed.

:six: **Refrain from discussing stream disputes.**  
User bans, timeouts, reports, and the like should be privately brought to a @Stream Chat Moderator. Extended discussion of these matters in a public setting may result in action being taken towards the users participating in it.

Additionally, please keep within the boundaries of the **Discord Partnership Code of Conduct**.  As a partnered server, we are expected to moderate to this standard.  Check out the full document here: <https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024871991-Discord-Partnership-Code-of-Conduct>

This Discord server has a warning/strike system in place which the @Server Staff enforce. You can read about this system, as well as other policies, here: <https://bit.ly/3gd4UoM>
